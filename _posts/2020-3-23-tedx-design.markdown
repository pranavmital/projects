I worked as a Product Designer for the 2020 edition of my university’s TEDx event. My job was to design the contents of the goodie bag which was to be given to all speakers and attendees. I also had the task of designing the entry ticket.   

The goal was to create a set of items that would generate hype and increase ticket sales. The goal was definitely met, as this year, tickets got sold out for the first time in the event's history.

In the paragraphs that follow, I’ll give a product by product breakdown of what went through my head as I designed each of them and why I did what I did.  

### The Ticket 
The ticket was the item I started with. At the time, I was very inspired by Virgil Abloh’s work and I wanted to incorporate his eccentric style into my design. A barcode was one of the first things that came to my mind when I envisioned a ticket and I decided to make it the hero of my design. I just wasn’t sure how.

After playing around for a bit, I got the idea of placing one barcode over another to form the **X**in TEDx and just like that, I had my hero element.

At first, I used dummy barcodes to form the **X** but then later thought to myself, “why not use actual ones?” and so, I went to [this website](https://barcode.tec-it.com/en/Code128) and generated a [Code 128](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_128) barcode which returned the text ‘TEDxNIITUniversity’ upon scanning and made the **X** using that newly generated barcode.

### The Bookmark
The theme of this year’s event was ‘Quo Vadis?’, which is latin for ‘where are we headed?’. In my design of the bookmark, I visually told the story of the journey of two rectangles which go from being mundane, easy to ignore shapes to becoming the famous TEDx **X** and thus showed ‘where they were headed’.

### The Diary
I believe that the TEDx event is better than all the others that take place on our campus and I wanted to express that feeling. I took a geometric pattern, drew an acute-angled **X** and played around with the opacity sliders to come up with this design.

In a dull and grey sea, the **X** sails vibrantly.

### The Laptop Sticker
My team lead told me that the printing agency could only print circular stickers. This was a constraint given to me, but I didn’t want the users of the sticker to get to know that. Oftentimes, designs look like they’ve been forcefully masked or cropped into a particular shape, and I wanted to prevent exactly that. 

I wanted it to seem like the shape of the sticker and the design of the sticker were made for each other. I like to think of this as being metaphorically analogous to when a company is able to design the software as well as the hardware of a product and deliver a seamless experience. 

So I started thinking of things I see in everyday life that are circular and after iterating through many, I landed on circular traffic signs and came up with this design.

However, it wasn't well received and I was asked to come up with something else. That's when the idea of a vinyl record occurred to me.

One challenge that came with picking the vinyl idea was that it could be stuck by the user in any orientation because there isn't any 'correct orientation'. Because of this, I needed to make sure that the graphic at the center of the vinyl is orientation agnostic. This eliminated the possibilty of using a right-angled cross to form the **X** as that would look like a 'plus' if rotated, and this led to me choosing to place an acute-angled **X** in the vinyl. I looked through the reposiory of graphics our team had made for different purposes and found an interesting isometric illustration of the **X** which was made by my team lead, [Abhilash](https://www.behance.net/abhilashbhowmik). I decided to use that as the center graphic of my vinyl.

### The Certificate
The organizer wanted to include a certificate in the goodie bag for all attendees. Since there’s no real prestige associated with simply attending a TEDx event somewhere, creating a serious certificate of attendance seemed a bit silly to me. I didn’t think a certificate would useful in any way other than as a souvenir. 

I wanted to create something that would make attendees remember the event. Something that they might stick on their pin-board or the wall behind their desk. I wanted to be a bit quirky with it and so, I came up with the idea of making the certificate pose itself as giving a TED talk. A TEDx certificate giving a TED talk? TEDception!
