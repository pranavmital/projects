I worked as a Product Designer for the 2020 edition of my university’s TEDx event. My job was to design the contents of the goodie bag which was to be given to all speakers as well as every person who bought a ticket to the event. I also had the task of designing the ticket itself.   

The goal was to create a set of items that would generate hype and lead to healthy number of tickets getting sold.

In the paragraphs that follow, I’ll give a product by product breakdown of what went through my head as I designed each of them and why I did what I did.
