La Senyera is an internet media organisation that caters to news related to the Spanish football club FC Barcelona. It has over 460,000 followers on Facebook and over 75,000 followers on Instagram.

I worked as a Creative Editor at La Senyera from March 2018 to October 2018. One of things I did in my time there was conceptualising and initialising 'The Senyera Podcast' or 'La Senyera Podcast' (Spanish).
