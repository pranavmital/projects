La Senyera is an internet media organisation that caters to news related to the Spanish football club FC Barcelona. It has over 460,000 followers on Facebook and over 75,000 followers on Instagram.

I worked as a Creative Editor at La Senyera from March 2018 to October 2018. One of things I did in my time there was conceptualising and initialising 'The Senyera Podcast' or 'La Senyera Podcast' (Spanish).

In the 4th episode, I spoke in the podcast. My co-host and I talked about transfer rumors and the then upcoming FIFA World Cup Final.

The episode was aired live on [La Senyera's Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/Lasenyera.en/) and over 3K viewers joined live. It has garnered 27K views till date. You can check out the episode below:
